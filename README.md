#  Prometheus Phoenixstats Exporter for PhoenixMiner-AMD

This is a containerised version of Phoenixstats for Prometheus, a simple PHP web stats page that utilises the remote monitoring ports (JSON-RPC API) available on PhoenixMiner. It was containerised for use on Unraid but should work on other hosts as well. This container allows you to view the following stats pulled from your miners:

* Global hash rate for all miners
* Miner uptime
* Miner version
* Connected pool and port
* Submitted, stale and invalid shares
* Per GPU hash rates
* Per GPU temperatures
* Per GPU fan percentages
